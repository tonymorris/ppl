### Briefing Notes

#### Climbing

* Lift perpendicular to Relative Air Flow (RAF)

* Weight always centre of Earth

* VCW ~ Vertical Component of Weight

* RCW ~ Rearward Component of Weight

##### Principles

* Climb is defined by an increase in altitude at constant airspeed

* Thrust = Drag + RCW

* Excess Thrust = Climb performance

* Best angle of climb (Vx)

  * Force = mass x acceleration

  * Thrust is a force

  * Vx is the greatest difference between Thrust Available (TA) and Thrust
    Required (TR)

  * Vx corresponds to an airspeed on a thrust versus speed graph

* Best rate of climb (Vy)

  * Work = Force (thrust) x distance

  * Power = Work / Time

  * ∴ Power = (Thrust x distance) / time

  * Speed = distance / time

  * ∴ Power = Thrust x speed

  * Vy is the greatest difference between Power Available (PA) and Power Required
    (PR)

  * Vy corresponds to an airspeed on power versus speed graph

##### Factors Affecting Climb Performance


| Factor                | Angle of Climb | Rate of climb |
|:----------------------|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Decrease weight       | increase       | increase      |
| Flap extension        | decrease       | decrease      |
| Head Wind             | increase       | neutral       |
| Tail Wind             | decrease       | neutral       |
| Increase Attitude[^1] | decrease       | decrease      |

[^1]: less air, less burn, less thrust

##### Application

| Power       | Full           | Full               | Full               |
| Attitude    | Screen@horizon | Nose lower than Vx | Nose lower than Vy |
| Performance | 57KIAS         | 62KIAS             | 75-85KIAS          |
| Rudder      | xxx            | xx (< Vx)          | x (< Vy)           |

#### Descending

* FCW ~ Forward Component of Weight

##### Principles

* Glide = no thrust

* Drag = FCW
