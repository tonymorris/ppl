## Climbing

### Aim

To learn the correct method of climbing in an aeroplane using various
performance profiles.

### Objectives

From memory correctly state:

1. The steps to enter and level off from a climb

2. The effect of decreased weight on angle and rate of climb

3. The best, angle, and cruise climb speeds for a C162

4. The degree of rudder input required during each of the three climb profiles

| Climb              | Vx            | Vy           | Cruise |
|:-------------------|:-------------:|:------------:|:------:|

| Attitude           | Top of screen | Combing/Dash | Nose   |
| Performance (KIAS) | 57            | 62           | 75-80  |
| Rudder input       | +++           | ++           | +      |

## Descending

### Aim

To learn to descend the aircraft at given airspeeds, rates of descent, and power
settings.

### Objectives

* From memory, correctly state the steps to enter and level off from a descent.

* From memory, correctly state the effect of a given airspeed greater than best
  glide on a glide range.

* From memory, correctly state how best glide range is achieved.

| Glide    | Idle    | Normal Cruise        | 70KIAS        |
| Cruise   | 2000rpm | 1deg down            | 90KIAS 500FPM |
| Approach | 1500rpm | Half sky/half ground | 75KIAS 500FPM |

### Briefing Notes

#### Climbing

* Lift perpendicular to Relative Air Flow (RAF)

* Weight always centre of Earth

* VCW ~ Vertical Component of Weight

* RCW ~ Vertical Component of Weight

##### Principles

* Climb is defined by an increase in altitude at constant airspeed

* Thrust = Drag + RCW

* Excess Thrust = Climb performance

* Best angle (Vx)

  * Force = mass x acceleration

  * Thrust is a force

  * Vx is the greatest difference between Thrust Available (TA) and Thrust
    Required (TR)

  * Vx corresponds to an airspeed on a thrust versus speed graph

* Best rate of climb (Vx)

  * Work = Force (thrust) x distance

  * Power = Work / Time

  * ∴ Power = (Thrust x distance) / time

  * Speed = distance / time

  * ∴ Power = Thrust x speed

  * Vy is the great difference between Power Available (PA) and Power Required
    (PR)

  * Vy corresponds to an airspeed on power versus speed graph

##### Factors Affecting Climb Performance


| Factor                | Angle of Climb | Rate of climb |
|:----------------------|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Decrease weight       | increase       | increase      |
| Flap extension        | decrease       | decrease      |
| Head Wind             | increase       | neutral       |
| Tail Wind             | decrease       | neutral       |
| Increase Attitude[^1] | decrease       | decrease      |

[^1]: less air, less burn, less thrust

##### Application

| Climb       | Vx             | Vy                 | Cruise             |
|:------------|:--------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|
| Power       | Full           | Full               | Full               |
| Attitude    | Screen@horizon | Nose lower than Vx | Nose lower than Vy |
| Performance | 57KIAS         | 62KIAS             | 75-85KIAS          |
| Rudder      | xxx            | xx (< Vx)          | x (< Vy)           |

* ASPT during climb

  * **A**ttitude level

  * **S**peed (wait to increase)

  * **P**ower (reduce to cruise)

  * **T**rim

* Climb

  * P.A.S.T. (entry)

  * A.L.A.P. (maintain)

  * A.S.P.T. (exit)

##### Airmanship

* 500ft check lookout

* maintain balance with rudder using ball indicator

* slow power changes (throttle)

##### Threat & Error Management

* Threat from aircraft: Nose-up obstructs view
  Manage: 500ft check

* Threat from pilot: illness e.g. sinus
  Manage: No Fly

* Threat from environment: Sun obstructing view
  Manage: don't climb into Sun

#### Descending

* FCW ~ Forward Component of Weight

##### Principles

* Glide = no thrust

* Drag = FCW

##### Factors Affecting Descent Performance

| Factor                | Angle of Climb | Rate of climb |
|:----------------------|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Decrease weight       | neutral        | decrease      |
| Flap extension        | increase       | increase      |
| Head Wind             | increase       | neutral       |
| Tail Wind             | decrease       | neutral       |
