# Turning

# 20151220

### Aim

To learn how to conduct various types of turn, and to turn accurately towards a
features and on to specific headings

### Objectives

From memory correctly state:

* Using the model, correctly state the force that turns the aircraft.

* From memory, correctly state the effect on turning performance when IAS is
  increased.

* From memory, correctly state the technique to enter, maintain, and exit a
  medium level turn.

----

* VCL ~ Vertical Component of Lift

* HCL ~ Horizontal Component of Lift

* Turn is caused by HCL

* Load Factor (LF) = Lift:Weight

  * Straight & Level, 1:1

  * 30deg, 1.15:1

  * 60deg, 2:1

### Turn Performance

* AoB ~ Angle of Bank

* With constant IAS and increasing AoB

  * Turn Radius decreases

  * Rate of Turn increases

* With increasing IAS and constant AoB

  * Turn Radius increases

  * Rate of Turn decreases

### Adverse Aileron Yaw

* Adverse Aileron Yaw is tendency to yaw out of turn

* Frise Aileron to counteract

* Differential Aileron to counteract

### Slip and Skid

* Turn indicator to the left
