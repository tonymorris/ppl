### Stalling *(20160104)*

* **What is the relevance of the Critical Angle of Attack?**

  The Angle of Attack (chord line to RAF) at which the lift coefficient is at
  its maximum and the aircraft stalls. Increasing AoA after Critical rapidly
  reduces the lift coefficient.

* **What is the effect of weight on an aircraft stall speed?**

  As weight increases, stall speed increases.

* **What is the effect of power on an aircraft stall speed?**

  As power increases, stall speed decreases.

* **What is the effect of flap on an aircraft stall speed?**

  increases.

* **What is the effect of load factor on an aircraft stall speed?**

  As load factor increases, stall speed increases.

* **What is the HASELL process?**

  * **H**eight: Must recover by 3000AGL

     between each stall

   What is the new stall speed?**

  `LF = 1 / cos AoB`
   
  `New stall speed = Vs * (LF ^ 0.5)`

* **What is a consequence of aileron in a stall?**

  Aileron on the stalled down wing will increase the AoA of the outer wing,
  resulting in wingdrop and possible spin.

* **What are the indicators and recovery of an impending stall?**

  * Slow and decaying airspeed

  * Nose-high attitude

  * Less wind noise

  * Controls less responsive

  * To recover, lower nose

* **What are the indicators and recovery of a developed stall?**

  * loss of height *(guaranteed)*

  * nose drop *(maybe)*

  * wing drop *(maybe)*

  * To recover, lower nose to level, add full power, right rudder. After
    sufficient airspeed, raise nose slightly

* **What are common faults of stall recovery?**

  * lowering nose too far (do not exceed loss of > 100ft altitude)

  * delayed application of full power

  * pull up too quickly after recovery -> secondary stall

* **What threats exist in inducing a stall?**

  Low power setting can cause carburetor icing. Apply carburetor heat until
  stall warning, then turn off.
