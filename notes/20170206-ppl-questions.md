### density altitude

* I believe

  * pressure altitude = &#955; QNH. (ISA<sub>pressure</sub> - QNH) * 30

  * density altitude = &#955; temp palt ele. (temp - (ISA<sub>temp</sub>) + (palt / 500)) * 120 + ele

* Bob Tait PPL Study Guide

  * Density altitude is a function of palt and temp using a flight computer

* **Questions**

  * **Why isn't the elevation required to be known according to the book?**

  * **What is the function that the flight computer is applying?**

  * **How important is the flight computer if the function is known and can be accurately applied?**

### VDO, air switch, tachometer (how does it work?), hobbs

* **What is the difference between VDO, air switch, tachometer, hobbs meter?**

* **Does the tachometer measure engine revolutions only and if so, how is that less than the air switch after a flight?**
