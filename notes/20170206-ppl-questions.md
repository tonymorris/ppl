# PPL questions

### abstract

Questions gathered during PPL study.

Required materials:

* this list of questions

* VTC/VNC

* Bob Tait PPL Study Guide

* ASA E6-B flight computer

##### Density Altitude

* I believe

  * pressure altitude = &#955; QNH. (ISA<sub>pressure</sub> - QNH) * 30

  * density altitude = &#955; temp palt ele. (temp - (ISA<sub>temp</sub>) + (palt / 500)) * 120 + palt

* **How important is the flight computer if the function is known and can be accurately applied?**

* **Bob Tait claims this is beyond PPL level, however, can I universally apply this function without caring about the rest?** *(ref: Tait PPL page 4)*

###### Questions re: VNC

* **meta-question: where would I find the answers to questions about VTC/VNC?**

* **What is the plus/minus sign next to a elevation AMSL e.g. MOUNT CROSBY?**

* **What is a "GROUP OBSTACLE" exactly?**

* **What is the number/letter in a RESTRICTED AREA? I find a reference to this number in the ERSA. What is its meaning? e.g. Amberley R625D**

* **Similar to previous question, there is e.g. D666 in a Class C LL 2000 boundary east of Target?**

* **Why isn't the QRS site at Jimboomba marked? There is a legend entry for MODEL ROCKET.**

* **What is a "VFR ROUTE"?**

* **What is "FLY NEIGHBOURLY"?**

* **What is "TACAN"? e.g. runways at YAMB.**

* **Why are DRIVE-IN THEATRES marked? See legend.**

* **What is the symbol on the south side of the Brisbane River, east of the Gateway Bridge, west of oil refinieries?**

* **What are the colour markings on areas?**

  * yellow

  * dark green

  * light green

  * grey

  * white

* **Do the points marked with a yellow circle have any significance? e.g. LOGAN VILLAGE, MOUNT NEBO**

----

##### TAS

* **Is TAS a measure of the true distance in air, and therefore, a function of ground speed?** *(ref: Tait PPL page 12)*

----

##### CAS

* CAS is a function of QNH, OAT, TAS. *(ref: Tait PPL page 13)*

* **What is that function?**

* **Can CAS be measured by any other set of variables?**

----

##### Aircraft weights

* **Clarify:** *(ref: Tait PPL page 21)*

  * BEW

  * Operating Weight

  * ZFW

  * Ramp Weight

  * MTOW

  * MLW

  * Floor Loading Limits

----

##### ALA

* Regarding physical properties of ALA, a CAAP is published by CASA *(ref: Tait PPL page 26)*

* **Which CAAP?**

----

##### Loading System Alpha

* The chart measures moment index using metric units. *(ref: Tait PPL page 39)*

* **Will LS Alpha always use metric units?**

* **Does it pertain to a specific aircraft type [since LS Bravo is similar to C172 loading]?**

----

##### VDO, air switch, tachometer (how does it work?), hobbs

* **What is the difference between VDO, air switch, tachometer, hobbs meter, specifically, what instrument measures them?**

* **Does the tachometer measure engine revolutions only and if so, how is that less than the air switch after a flight?**
